in this, the player gets a choice of two doors at the beginning, one of them being a crazy adventure, the other being a normal scene. 
if you pick the wrong door (the crazy adventure one) then you gotta fight your way out until you find a door to leave. 
once you leave, you get another set of doors but there's 4 this time. 
3 of them are an adventure, 1 is normal. 
then there's a set of 8 doors, 2 being normal, 6 are crazy adventuress.
then 16 doors, 4 being normal, 12 being adventures. 
once the user has beat the last set of doors, there's a cool ending.
